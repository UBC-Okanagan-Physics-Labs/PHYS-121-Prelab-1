    "This pre-lab will be used to develop some insights that will help you begin to meet the learning objectives for Lab #1.  Furthermore, the pre-lab will introduce some of the Python functions that will be used to analyze the data that you collect during the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a quantity, such as the period of a pendulum, is measured many times using the same measurement technique, one obtains a **distribution** of measurements.  Most of the time (but not always), the data follow a **Gaussian** distribution which is also known as a **normal** distribution or **bell curve** (Fig. 1). The figure below shows an ideal Gaussian distribution which has been scaled (or normalized) so that the total area beneath the curve is one. The peak of the distribution occurs at the **mean** $\\mu$ and its width is characterized by the **standard deviation** $\\sigma$.  The horizonal axis in Fig. 1 shows the locations of $\\mu$, $\\mu\\pm\\sigma$, $\\mu\\pm 2\\sigma$, and $\\mu\\pm 3\\sigma$.\n",

    "<b>Fig. 1: An ideal Gaussian distribution.</b></center>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "When collecting experimental data, you tpyically won't see a smooth curve like the one in Fig. 1.  We often use **histograms** to display the distribution of experimental measurements.  First we define ranges of values called **bins**, and then we count the number of datapoints that fall into each range.  For example, if you were to measure the speed of different objects in the asteroid belt, you could define your bins to be $1\\rm\\ km/s$ wide.  A measurement of $17.8\\rm\\ km/s$ (the average orbital speed of Ceres) would add a count to the $17-18\\rm\\ km/s$ bin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As more and more data is collected, histograms will approximate the shape of a Gaussian distribution. To exactly reproduce the ideal distribution in Fig. 1, one would need to make an infinite number of measurements of the quantity of interest and then plot a histogram of those data.  This is impractical, of course, so we can only hope to use a finite set of data to approximate an ideal distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The 68-95-99.7 rule**<br>\n",
    "The area between two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ beneath a normalized Gaussian distribution gives the probability that a single measurement $x$ will fall between those values.  For example, in Fig. 1 region shaded dark blue extends from $x_1=\\mu-\\sigma$ to $x_2=\\mu+\\sigma$ and has an area of $0.68$.  This observation implies that $68\\%$ of measurements are expected to fall within one standard deviation $\\sigma$ of the mean $\\mu$.  In a similar way, $95\\%$ of measurements are expected to fall within $\\pm 2\\sigma$ of the mean and $99.7\\%$ of measurements are expected to fall within $\\pm 3\\sigma$ of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "When estimating the uncertainty of a single measurement, one is trying to estimate the standard deviation that would be obtained if the measurement was repeated many times (without actually doing the repeated measurements). "

    "From **Parts 1** and **2** of this pre-lab, you should have seen that the standard deviation $\\sigma$, which characterizes the width of a Gaussian distribution, is independent of the number of trials $N$.  The standard deviation $\\sigma$ is used to estimate the uncertainty of any single trial of an experiment.  The physical interpretation is that any single measurement has approximately a $68\\%$ chance of falling within one standard deviation of the mean $\\mu$.  That is, each measurement has a $68\\%$ chance of falling between $\\mu-\\sigma$ and $\\mu+\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although $\\sigma$ is independent of $N$, our ability to locate the peak or mean value of a distribution of measurements improves as $N$ increases.  This is because the distribution of measurements better approximates an ideal Gaussian distribution with a smooth peak and symmetric tails as $N$ is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard error in the mean** (often referred to simply as the **standard error**) is an estimate of the uncertainty in the calculated mean from a set of data. We will denote the standard error by $\\sigma_\\mu$. The standard error is calculated by dividing the standard deviation $\\sigma$ by the square root of the number of trials $N$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sigma_\\mu = \\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}.\n",
    "\\label{eq:stderror} \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Understanding where this expression comes from requires a proper treatment of the propagation of errors which is beyond the scope of PHYS 121.  However, if you choose to pursue a physics degree, we will revisit error propagation and standard error in the Modern Physics Laboratory course PHYS 232."

    "In the plot above, you should see a pair of overlaid histograms.  The blue and orange bars represent the set of simulated data with $N=20$ and $N=1000$ trials, respectively.  You should notice that the orange data better approximate an ideal Gaussian distribution and thus the mean value of the distribution is easier to locate.  This plot also emphasizes that the two distributions have approximately the same width, related to the fact that the standard deviation $\\sigma$ is independent of the size $N$ of the dataset.\n",

In fact, the standard deviation $\\sigma$ represents the uncertainty in the value of any single trial of the experiment.  In Lab 1, we will see how the uncertainty in the mean of a set of $N$ measurements can be estimated. "
